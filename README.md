## What is MovieTogether?
MovieTogether is an application that allows for collaborative rating of movies with your friends. Designed with simplicity in mind, just add movies to the [movie superlist](###Using-The-Movie-Superlist) and start rating! The app allows for independent user accounts with unique [ratings](###Rating-Movies) and [rating lists](###User-Rating-Lists), so that every user of your Movie Board has a voice.

MovieTogether is also multi-platform! As a user of MovieTogether you have the choice of rating movies through the website, or by [linking your account](###Linking-To-Discord) to a Discord channel for the exact same functionality!
